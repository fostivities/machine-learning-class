### Overview of Machine Learning
- Subfield of AI
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - AI dream â€“ machines as intelligent as humans
	- Overhyped and a long way away from it
	- Researchers believe learning algorithms is best way to get to this goal
- State of AI in 2020 - Study by McKenzie
	- AI/ML $13t in value annually by 2030
- Vast unfulfilled demand for this skillset

### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
	- Arthur Samule (1959)
- Two main types of ML
	- Supervised learning
		- Used most in real-world applications
		- Seen most rapid advancements
		- Course 1, 2
	- Unsupervised learning
		- Course 3
		- recommender systems and reinforcement learning
